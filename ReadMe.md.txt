- extracting list of cities visited from google map history

If you are curious to see the list of cities that you visited during a month and the date of the visit I could provide you a sample code to do that. Although, now Google Timeline feature gives you interesting information regarding your previous visits, but there is a lot more information that you can extract from the google map history that Google collected for you. First, you should be sure that you have given Google to collect your location data. You check that by going to Google Timeline in the Google Maps app, and activating if it's not already. 

Next, you should download your Google Map history by visiting Google Takeout. Now you have all the information you need to process the data. There are a lot of things that you can do with this data. But in this repo, I decided to just extract the list of the cities that I visited each month and the date of that visit. Feel free to check the code and use it. Also, you can do more stuff with this interesting data that you have.
